The truth is,              people do not have health insurance as we used to know it. Most have high deductible health insurance,                 which means their day-to-day healthcare needs are met with out-of-pocket dollars, while half the                                        bankruptcies have to do with a catastrophic illness.              True insurance today is prevention, because for over 95% of the population, it is not genetics but how we                live and take care of ourselves. The good news is that for most diseases, there are a set number of             inducers and promoters that, if addressed, will make people preventative with their health, which means                  they can prevent prevalent diseases like cancer, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, etc.                    However, the challenge for most people is their lack of access to this kind of information, the                  technologies, and programs available, and the specially trained healthcare practitioners who can                                             empower society on a journey of health.                What is exciting, beyond the concept of prevention, is how with new technology, we can also turn back              the clock of time for people to look younger, slimmer, stronger, more vibrant, and alive, in just days. Not             weeks, months, or years. This kind of healthcare is, unfortunately, not understood or spoken about by our                                                     disease care physicians.                The Changing Life \& Destiny Conference is a gathering of Integrative, Functional and Nutrition oriented                  healthcare practitioners, and health professionals. Many are members of the Functional Health               Network and are interested in learning about the latest technologies in the health and wellness space                                                 that they can offer their patients.               At the 2024 conference, the Health-100 Collective is being showcased. These are 100 programs, products,                 devices, tests, and assessments that can help people restore health, prevent disease and promote                                                            wellness.​               Clinicians that offer 25 or more of these technologies can become a Top Technology HP and benefit from                patient referrals that originate from the Luv UR Health Movement and platforms that can educate               patients on their offerings, such as a Clinic Metaverse. In fact, the Clinic Metaverse will be a paradigm                   shift in how patients can be educated and excited, on technologies being offered by the clinic.               Many of these technologies can be experienced at the conference via Masterclass Workshops on Friday,             and presentations on Saturday and Sunday. Some of these technologies may not require patients to even                                   visit the clinic but can be accessed virtually or via a dropship.                 There is a revolution taking place around prevention and our ability to promote wellness, which our              standard of care is at best not understanding, and at worst, keeping quiet. This conference, the Health-                 100 Collective, and Top Technology HP platforms will help practitioners and health and wellness                            professionals implement the latest and most successful offerings available.

Blood circulation is accelerated, toxins and waste are                                                   broken down and sent to be eliminated. Mucous, cholesterol,                                                   and fat which can adhere to the arteries and vein walls are also                                                   dispersed and gradually can be eliminated by the body. Fresh                                                   oxygen and nutrients are circulated faster through the blood,                                                    detoxing the organs. Now cells and genes can start to be                                                   repaired and be rejuvenated by the body.

These arteries, located on each side of your neck, supply blood to                                                    your brain.

This is often an early sign of atherosclerosis, a disease that                                                   can lead to serious conditions such as heart attacks and strokes.
